/**
 * We have a list of piles of stones,
 * each pile of stones has a certain weight,
 * represented by an array of integers.
 * In each move,
 * we can merge two adjacent piles into one larger pile,
 * the cost is the sum of the weights of the two piles.
 * We merge the piles of stones until we have only one pile left.
 * Determine the minimum total cost.
 *
 * Assumptions
 *
 * stones is not null and is length of at least 1
 * Examples
 *
 * {4, 3, 3, 4}, the minimum cost is 28
 *
 * merge first 4 and first 3, cost 7
 *
 * merge second 3 and second 4, cost 7
 *
 * merge two 7s, cost 14
 *
 * total cost = 7 + 7 + 14 = 28
 *
 * Hard
 * array
