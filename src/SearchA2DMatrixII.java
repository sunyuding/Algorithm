/**
 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
 * This matrix has the following properties:
 *
 * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 * Consider the following matrix:
 *
 * [
 *   [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
 *   [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
 *   [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
 *   [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
 *   [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
 * ]
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: matrix, target = 5
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: matrix, target = 20
 * Output: false
