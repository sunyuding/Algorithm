/**
 * Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number.
 * Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another leaf node.
 * If there is no such path available,
 * return Integer.MIN_VALUE(Java)/INT_MIN (C++).
 *
 * Examples
 *
 *   -15
 *
 *   /    \
 *
 * 2      11
 *
 *      /    \
 *
 *     6     14
 *
 * The maximum path sum is 6 + 11 + 14 = 31.
 *
 * How is the binary tree represented?
 *
 * We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.
 *
 * For Example:
 *
 * The sequence [1, 2, 3, #, #, 4] represents the following binary tree:
 *
 *     1
 *
 *   /   \
 *
 *  2     3
 *
 *       /
 *
 *     4
